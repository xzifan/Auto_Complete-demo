# AutoCompletion Demo   
This is a demo of autocompletion (search bar/ text box). 

![screenshot](./screenshot.jpg)  

The suggestion of words and expressions will show up in color gray. With a click of `TAB`, the textfield will complete with the suggestion.  
The vocalbulary is based on what have been submitted. Expressions and words that are submitted can be used for later autocompletion.    

<em>For easier testing, the demo will load [10000 vocabulary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/first20hours/google-10000-english/master/google-10000-english-no-swears.txt) and 1 expression `"what's the weather like"` by default.</em>
